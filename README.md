- Sri Lanka indeed faced a severe economic crisis from 2020 to 2022, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic and long-term indebtedness. This crisis resulted in a significant shortage of US dollars, which posed challenges for the government in procuring fuel and essential commodities. Given the country's heavy reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation, this economic situation had a profound impact. Consequently, many people experienced frequent power outages that disrupted their daily lives and activities. In response to these challenges, we developed a rechargeable multiplug.
- We essentially developed a standard multiplug. In the event of a power outage, it can automatically manage to power lower-power consuming devices like Wi-Fi routers and mobile phone chargers. It features three socket outlets, each equipped with three individual switches, all of which are touch-sensitive.

- To enhance safety, we implemented a touch panel on/off mechanism system. This system was introduced after our survey revealed that many people had experienced electric shocks when using electrical equipment with damp hands.
